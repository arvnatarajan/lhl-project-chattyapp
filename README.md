### Project Details
This is one of the projects I completed during a two-month web development bootcamp at [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca/about) in Toronto.

This React app enables users to chat with others connected to the server. The server broadcasts new users and name changes.

Technologies used:
  * Node.js
  * React
  * Web Sockets
  * Express
  * MongoDB
  * Heroku

Completed in Week 3 of our 8-week bootcamp, this was our first introduction to React, and I loved it. The concept of components, having everything update via state and the ease with which we could make changes really appealed to me.
